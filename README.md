# Titanium Theme Builder

A quick and easy way to generate [Titanium](https://www.appcelerator.com/mobile-app-development-products/) TSS-based color themes for your next cross-platform native mobile app.

Just want to use it? Go to [https://adamtarmstrong.github.io/titanium-theme-builder](https://adamtarmstrong.github.io/titanium-theme-builder) (it's free).

## How Does it Work?

Use the provided visual tools to tweak colors, borders, fonts, and such. Once you are happy, click the "Download Theme" button to download the custom TSS file for your Titanium app. Styles will be applied globally to both iOS and Android (except where noted).

## Native Mobile App + CSS?

Titanium uses a subset of TSS (similar to CSS) to style apps. You can apply TSS to individual elements by id, classes, and types. Read more about [Dynamic Styles here](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Dynamic_Styles).

## Shout Outs

* [Ionic's CSS components](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/) made it possible to accurately simulate cross-platform UI elements in a web browser.
* Special thanks to the (now defunct) [Ionic Theme Editor](https://github.com/pbernasconi/ionic-theme-editor) for site design inspiration.
